random.randint(min, max)
#Returns a random int between min and max inclusive

random.random()
#Returns a random float between 0 and 1

random.uniform(min, max)
#Returns a random float between min and max

random.seed(1)
#Fixes the random generator so that it gives the same sequence of numbers each time. Can change 1 to another number for a different fixed sequence. Helpful for debugging!
