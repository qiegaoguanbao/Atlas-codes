#If you know how many times your loop will run, use a for-loop.

#If you donâ€™t know how many times your loop will run, use a while-loop.


#For Loops 

#A for-loop as three parts:

#Loop Variable - the variable that keeps track of count

#Range - which numbers should we loop over

#Code Body - the block of code that gets repeated at each iteration


def main():
   for i in range(5):
        print("I can count to", i + 1) 

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
  
  
#range()

#for i in range(some number):


#All numbers start to stop(stop is not included)
range(stop)
#Ex: range(10) gives you: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9


#All numbers start to stop(stop is not included)
range(start, stop)
Ex: range(2,8) gives you: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7


#All numbers start to stop, taking step steps at a time
range(start, stop, step)
#Ex: range(0,10,2) gives you: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8




#While Loops
def main():
	print("Pop Quiz! How many continents are there on Earth?")
	answer = int(input())
	while(answer != 7):
		print("Not quite, guess again!")
		answer = int(input())
	print("That's right! There are seven continents on Earth!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
		
		
		
		
#Infinite Loops
# The key to thwarting an infinite loop is to loop for conditions that will never be False 

# The boolean value True will never be False
while True:
    # Do something

# i keeps decreasing and will always be less than 1
i = 0
while i < 1:
    i = i - 1

# Since two values are always either equal or not equal this 
# condition will never be false
a = True
b = False
while (a == b) or (a != b):
    # Do something
